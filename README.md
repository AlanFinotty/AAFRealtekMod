# Realtek Audio Driver Mods by Alan Finotty

* Compatibility

This driver package is supported on Windows 7, 8, 8.1 and 10 systems.

* Uninstalling the package for migration to other Realtek driver packages.

When you remove this driver package, everything that was selected at the time of installation will be removed (including in previous systems). The Dolby Atmos, Nahimic 3 and Sound Blaster Connect 2 apps will be removed. The main driver, extension drivers and software components will also have their copies removed from the system cache **(%systemroot%\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository)**.

* Purpose of this project

Help those who have a motherboard with a Realtek audio chip (whether new or old - my case) and who want to extract superior audio quality in music, movies, games or other content.

I hope to be able to help all internet users interested in these packages.
